# Genetic-Cross 
A program to cross a set of genes using Mendel's second law and display their change throughout the generations.

This program takes two initial individuals (called seeds here) with genetic configuration set by the user and simulates possible offsprings, having in mind the crosses occurr only among the offspring itself (basically... incest)

Progress: Almost done
